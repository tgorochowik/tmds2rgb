tmds-dump-analyzer

This is a TMDS dump analyzer. It takes TMDS data and tries to extract raw rgb
data along with information about it. TMDS format is used by interfaces like
HDMI or DVI. This program can be used to validate data extracted from these
interfaces.

The tmds dump has to use 32b packages where the 2 last bits used as padding.

The data can be shifted, so there is no need to synchronize the data before
collecting the tmds dump.

Example usage:
./tda tmds.dump -1 -s -o rgb.dump -t

extracts a single frame from the tmds.dump file, adds blanks visualization and
saves it in rgb.dump file. The -t switch makes it also calculate and print the
resolution of the output image.

To view the extracted image, the ImageMagick suite (http://imagemagick.org/) is
recommended. For example to convert the rgb.dump to png format run:

convert -size 2201x1126 -depth 8 rgb:rgb.dump frame.png

For more detailed information about usage run ./tda --help
